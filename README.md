# Info-370-Final-Project
## Project Description ##
> The purpose of this research project is to find any trends in Donald Trump's twitter data. I will analyze a dataset of over 7000 tweets from Donald Trump. I discovered the dataset while I was on Reddit looking at the subreddit r/datasets. The reddit post came from a website (www.crowdbabble.com). The article I read was written by Abbas Alidina and I am assuming that is who collected the data. My target audience is anyone interested in politics or Donald Trump's personal life. My project will aim to answer the following three questions:
1. On average, do Trump's tweets tend to be positive or negative?
2. What are Trump's top most used words in his tweets?
