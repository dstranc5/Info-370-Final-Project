# Info-370-Final-Project
## Project Description ##
> The purpose of this research project is to find trends and patterns in Donald Trump's twitter data. We will analyze a dataset of over 7000 tweets from Donald Trump. We discovered the dataset while we were on Reddit looking at the subreddit r/datasets. The reddit post came from a website (www.crowdbabble.com). The article we read was written by Abbas Alidina and we are assuming that is who collected the data. Our target audience is anyone interested in politics or Donald Trump's personal tweets. My project will aim to answer the following three questions: 

1. On average, do Trump's tweets tend to be positive or negative?
2. What are Trump's most used words in his tweets?
3. Have Trumpâ€™s twitter semantics change over time?

## Technical Description ##
> The final product will be a HTML page compiled using KnitR. The dataset includes over 7000 tweets so parsing through the tweets efficiently might be a challenge. We will need to learn how to perform semantic analysis. We will also have to learn how to perform clustering techniques and techniques to develop useful graphs. We are intending to use either Time Series analysis and/or Clustering. Time series will be useful because the tweets are in a linear order, so hopefully we will be able to see patterns in his twitter data throughout time. Clustering will be useful to see if there are any patterns, or clusters, of data. One major challenge we expect is determining how we can compare/contrast the data. This is also the largest dataset that we have worked with, so it might get overwhelming
 at times.
